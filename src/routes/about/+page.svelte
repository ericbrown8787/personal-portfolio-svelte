      I’m a web developer, UI/UX designer, game developer and general purpose
      programmer from New Jersey. In 2021 I went back to school for an IT
      certificate, but after one semester I realized that I was passionate about
      programming, and I love the human-centered design processes of UI/UX and
      game development. I have a diverse set of skills and I consider myself a
      language-agnostic programmer. You can see some of my projects from the
      past two years in my portfolio, and I’m excited to get started on some
      more.

    <p class="about__text">
      I’m open to job opportunities where I can contribute to real projects,
      gain industry experience and learn from other developers. I’m also open to
      freelance work and less formal collaboration like hackathons, game jams
      and independent creative projects. If you’re looking for a developer for
      any of these and think I might be a good fit, don’t hesitate to contact
      me.
